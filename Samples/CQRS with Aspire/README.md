# CQRS solution with .NET Aspire

This example solution is a basic test for what it would look like to do CQRS as two separate APIs in one solution with .NET Aspire orchestration and integration tests.

Note: integration tests were achieved based on what I could figure out to be able to replace services - this solution does *not* make use of the Aspire integration testing framework as there is not enough examples/documentation to achieve this.
